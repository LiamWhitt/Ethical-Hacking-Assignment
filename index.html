            <h1>What is SQL injection? Definition, demonstration, and why you must know</h1>

                <p><br>Whether you are aware of <span class="keyword">SQLi (SQL Injection)</span> or not, this blog post will go over everything you need to know. But before I delve deep into ‘SQL Injecting’
                    and how it works, its impact, the potential causes, how it can be resolved etc, etc. I will need to explain what it actually is in the first place.
                </p>
                <br>
        <div class="section" id="section-1">
            <h2>What even is it?</h2>
            <p><br>There are a wide range of vulnerabilities that SQLi offers, such as:</p><br>
            <dl>
                <dt>Retrieving hidden data:</dt><br>
                <dd>- Manipulating SQL queries into giving hidden data.</dd><br>
                
                <dt>Subverting application logic:</dt><br>
                <dd>- Injecting code which can change how a site’s code processes input or data.</dd><br>
                
                <dt>Retrieving data from other database tables:</dt><br>
                <dd>- Injecting SQL code to gather data from a separate table and add it to the original query output.</dd><br>
            </dl> 

            <p>I will explain how these three main principles work but for a more general definition the creators of Burpe Suite A.K.A Portswigger (2024) define SQLi as:
               "A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database." This can allow an attacker to gain
               access to unauthorized user data, they also may be able to change said data or even delete it. If this were to happen it could cost a company a lot of money, not only
               legally but internally too as an attack could lead to a compromise to a server.</p><br>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="section-2">
            <h2>How does it even work?</h2><br>
            <h3>Retrieving hidden data:</h3>
            <p>Imagine your favourite (non-existent) start-up band has a ticket and merchandise website with the following URL:<br>
            <code>https://good-rock-band-bad-website.co.uk/merch?category=apparel</code>
            </p><br>

            <p>this URL contains all the clothing merchandise for your band.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, they for some reason have their home-made website running off a raspberry PI in their grandparent’s basement, which happens to be incredibly insecure and
            the site makes this SQL query to retrieve the data:</p><br>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM merch WHERE category = 'apparel' AND released = 1</code></p><br>

            <p>It wants all the details <code>(*)</code> from the <code>merch</code> table, where the <code>category</code> is <code>apparel</code> and <code>released</code> = <code>1</code>
            (true). We see that the site is using “released = 1” to only show released merchandise. However, what if we want the <i>unreleased</i> merchandise for the upcoming tour?
            Since the site has such poor security practises and is completely open to SQLi we can add a comment tag to the end of apparel:</p><br>

            <p><code>https://good-rock-band-bad-website.co.uk/merch?category=apparel’--</code></p><br>

            <p>Since the query takes the data from the URL and appends it straight into the request it now looks more like this:</p><br>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM merch WHERE category = 'apparel’--' AND released = 1</code></p><br>

            <p>Since it has appended a SQL comment tag it basically rendered the next part of code useless, thus removing the restriction so the site now shows the unreleased
            merchandise ready for the upcoming tour.</p><br>
