            <h1>What is SQL injection? Definition, demonstration, and why developers should care.</h1>

                <p><br>Whether you are aware of <span class="keyword">SQLi (SQL Injection)</span> or not, this blog post will go over everything you need to know. But before I delve deep into 
                    how it works, its impact, the potential causes, how it can be resolved etc, etc. I will need to explain what it actually is in the first place.
                </p>
                <br>
            <h2>What even is it?</h2>
            <p>There are a wide range of vulnerabilities that SQLi offers, such as:</p><br>
            <dl>
                <dt>Retrieving hidden data:</dt>
                <dd>- Manipulating SQL queries into giving hidden data.</dd><br>
                
                <dt>Subverting application logic:</dt>
                <dd>- Injecting code which can change how a site’s code processes input or data.</dd><br>
                
                <dt>Retrieving data from other database tables:</dt>
                <dd>- Injecting SQL code to gather data from a separate table and add it to the original query output.</dd><br>
            </dl> 

            <p>For a more general definition the amazing creators of Burpe Suite A.K.A Portswigger (2024) define SQLi as:</p><br>
            
            <p><q>A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. <a id = "reflink1" class = "rlink" href="#r2"><sup> [1]</sup></a></q></p><br>

            <h2>How does it even work?</h2><br>
            
            <h3>Retrieving hidden data:</h3>
            <p>Imagine your favourite (non-existent) start-up band has a ticket and merchandise website with the following URL:</p><br>
            <p><code>https://good-rock-band-bad-website.co.uk/merch?category=apparel</code></p>
            </p><br>

            <p>Unfortunately, they for some reason have their home-made website running off a raspberry PI in their grandparent’s basement, which happens to be incredibly insecure and
            the site makes this SQL query to retrieve the data:</p><br>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM merch WHERE category = 'apparel' AND released = 1</code></p><br>

            <p>It wants all the details <code>(*)</code> from the <code>merch</code> table, where the <code>category</code> is <code>apparel</code> and <code>released</code> = <code>1</code>. We see that the site is using “released = 1” to only show released merchandise. However, what if we want the <i>unreleased</i> merchandise for the upcoming tour?
            Since the site has such poor security practises and is completely open to SQLi we can add a comment tag (<code>--</code>) to the end of apparel in the query:</p><br>

            <p><code>https://good-rock-band-bad-website.co.uk/merch?category=apparel’ --</code></p><br>

            <p>New query:</p>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM merch WHERE category = 'apparel’ --' AND released = 1</code></p><br>

            <p id = "cheat-sheet">As it has appended a SQL comment tag it basically rendered the next part of code useless, thus removing the restriction so the site now shows the unreleased
            merchandise ready for the upcoming tour.</p><br>

            <span class = tip><b>TIP :</b> you can use the Portswigger (2024) “SQL Injection Cheat Sheet” where you can see a variety of different syntax’s you would use in an SQLi attack:<br>
                <a href = "https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet" style="color: rgb(0, 95, 95);">https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet</a></span>

            <h3>Subverting application logic:</h3>

            <br><p>Pretend that the non-existent “rock band” we saw earlier also has a login page to show your purchased tickets,
               this time it gives the check using the following query:</p><br>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Tyler' AND password = 'Cl4ncy'</code></p><br>

            <p>The example shown above is the credential check for “Tyler”, however since the website was developed by a band member to save money
               (who also knows nothing about our secret SQLi trick), we can not only login as “Tyler” but also as anyone.</p><br>

            <p>We can do this by adding a comment tag (<code>--</code>) at the end of the username in the query:</p><br>

            <p><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Tyler'--' AND password = ''</code></p><br>

            <p>Just like the last example it removes the last part of the code that checks for the password, allowing us to freely login as Tyler
               or even an administrator without prompting a password.</p><br>
            
            <h3>Retrieving data from other database tables:</h3>

            <p>This can also be commonly called an <span class = keyword>SQLi UNION attack.</span></p><br>

            <p id = "figure1">As I summarised before we are basically selecting other data and adding it back to the original query. This can be done with the <code>UNION</code> command.
               Portswigger (2024) give the example shown in figure 1 below:</p><br>

            <img src="assets\figure1.png" class="figure">
            <figcaption>Figure 1 : Example of a SQLi UNION command attack (Source: Portswigger 2024 <a id = "reflink1" class = "rlink" href="#r1"><sup> [1]</sup></a>)</figcaption><br>

            <p>the <code>UNION</code> command allows another <code>SELECT</code> keyword to be added, it then will get the outcome and append it to the original query.
               I will be using a more in-depth example for the demonstration later on!</p><br>

            <span class = tip>You can read more about <span class = keyword>UNION attacks</span> here:<br>
                <a href = "https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks" style="color: rgb(0, 95, 95);">
                    https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks</a></span><br>

            <h2>What impact does it have?</h2>
                <p>SQLi can allow an attacker to gain access to unauthorized user data, they also may be able to change said data or even delete it, this is due to SQL itself allowing the possibility
                    of the output data to be chosen from the database. If this were to happen it could cost a company a lot of money not only financially but legally too, as ordinary people’s identities
                    or money could also be stolen, this would affect reputation drastically. EC-Council (2024) states an example of this by saying:</p><br> 

                <p><q>An attacker can use SQL Injection in a financial application to make some transactions void, change balances, or move money from the user’s account to another account.<a id = "reflink2" class = "rlink" href="#r2"><sup> [2]</sup></a></q></p><br>
                
                <p>A big case that was reported by the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) themselves in 2016, was about the SQLi attack on major telecommunication brand TalkTalk. The report stated that the ICO issued:</p><br>
                    
                <p><q>Its biggest ever fine – £400,000 – to TalkTalk after taking into account a range of factors demonstrating the seriousness of the event. <a id = "reflink3" class = "rlink" href="#r3"><sup> [3]</sup></a></q></p><br>

                <p><i>Ouch</i> this is what happens when a company fails to comply with basic security practises...</p>
                <br>

            <h2>How can we test for it?</h2>
            <p>Lets use Portswigger's web-security academy vulnerability labs to learn how to test for SQL Injections, we will do a
               bit more of a complicated exercise compared to the examples I gave before.
            </p><br>

            <p>After we open the pre-configured browser inside Burp (Proxy -> Open Browser) we will visit our exercise:<br> "SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle"</p>
            </dl><br>

            <p>We are then greeted with the following webpage:</p><br>

            <img src="assets\img1.png" class="img">

            <p><br>Since we want to get information from other tables, we need to know how many columns it needs to make a valid request.</p><br>

            <p>First lets analyse the web page, we can determine that there are at least two columns as each item on the site has two entries; the title and description of the item.
                Also if we look there seems that there are really only links to exploit, but before we click on one we should let Burp Suite intercept the request.</p><br>

            <img src="assets\img2.png" class="img">

            <p><br>Simply press the button next to "Drop" and now if we click on one... lets just say "Gifts" and go into Burp and click on our target we get the following request:</p><br>

            <img src="assets\img3.png" class="img">

            <p><br>We should send this to the repeater so we can edit the request and send it back to the application.</p><br>

            <img src="assets\img4.png" class="img">

            <p><br>To find any low-level SQLi vulnerability we can simply go into the query and input an apostrophe <code>'</code> or quotation marks. In reference to Stack Overflow user Sampson, J. (2012),
                doing this would create: "ambiguity - the interpreter doesn't know where [the] string ends.<a id = "reflink4" class = "rlink" href="#r4"><sup> [4]</sup></a>" This results in a syntax error meaning we can inject things as
                the input is considered <span class = keyword>unsanitized</span> and we can <span class = keyword>escape</span> the current context. It also shows the user input can effect the syntax of the query, the string would now look more like this example:</p><br>

                <img src="assets\figure2.png" class="figure" style = "max-width: 50%;">
                <figcaption>The interpreter now reading the incoming input as actual code after the SQL code input. (Source: Sampson, J. 2012 <a id = "reflink4" class = "rlink" href="#r4"><sup> [4]</sup></a>)</figcaption><br>

            <img src="assets\img5.png" class="img">

            <p><br>Now we have to find how many columns the query has, the easiest way to do this is inputting 'NULL' until we get an OK from the server. In this case it was only two.
               This is a more complicated version of the <a href = "#figure1" style = "color: rgb(0, 95, 95)";>Portswigger example,</a> however the main difference is that we are selecting data
               from <code>DUAL</code> because according to pentestmonkey.net (2024)</p><br>

               <p><q>SELECT statements must have a FROM clause in Oracle so we have to use the dummy table name ‘dual’ when we’re not actually selecting from a table.<a id = "reflink5" class = "rlink" href="#r5"><sup> [5]</sup></a></q></p><br>

               <p>The DUAL table is practically a default table in Oracle that literally has only one column called "Dummy", it's only main use according to Keesling <i>et al.</i> (2024) is:</p><br>

               <p><q>When a value must be returned only once, for example, the current date and time. All database users have access to DUAL.<a id = "reflink6" class = "rlink" href="#r6"><sup> [6]</sup></a></q></p><br>

            <img src="assets\img6.png" class="img">

            <p><br>Next, if we find which one we can input text into by replacing <code>NULL</code> with any string such as "'test'" (which in this case was the first column).
               We now know which one to append our payload to as we see it worked.</p><br>

            <img src="assets\img7.png" class="img">

            <p><br>If we take a look at the <a href = "#cheat-sheet" style="color: rgb(0, 95, 95);">cheat-sheet</a> we can find what syntax we need for the database version for
            <span class = keyword>Oracle</span>, in this case it was <code>banner FROM v$version</code>. All there is left to do is input that into the string compatible column and the rest of the syntax.</p><br>
    
            <img src="assets\img8.png" class="img">

            <p><br>Et voila! we sent the request to the application and it has now displayed the database version! Congratulations on solving the lab.</p><br>

            <h2>What can cause it and how can we resolve/mitigate it?</h2>
            <p> Let's talk more about why they happen, they happen because the SQL query treats the user input as actual code. This can happen for a variety of reasons
                for example:</p><br>
            <div class = "causesList">
            <ul>
                <li>Developers which are untrained or unaware of SQLi</li>
                <li>Lack of security pen testing or code reviewing</li>
                <li>No input validation or sanitization such as parameterized queries</li>
                <li>Lack of compliance towards standardized frameworks such as OSI or OWASP</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p><br>One method that most mature databases use are <span class = keyword>Parameterized queries or prepared statements</span>,
                Stack Overflow user Parker (2011)<a id = "reflink7" class = "rlink" href="#r7"><sup> [7]</sup></a> defines them as:</p><br>

            <q>A means of pre-compiling a SQL statement so that all you need to supply are the "parameters"... that need to be inserted into the statement for it to be executed.
               It's commonly used as a means of preventing SQL injection attacks.</q>

            <p><br>Using a prepared statement would basically only execute the placeholders or "parameters" within the query, and it is a great way of separating SQL code from user input.</p>

            <p><br>The main route companies should always start with is standard compliance, not only would this mitigate legal issues, as the ICO would see that
               your company has implemented basic security features (unlike TalkTalk <i>*cough* *cough*</i>). But also in a more general way too as you would
               avoid the aforementioned causes.
            </p><br>
            <p>For the explanation on <span class = keyword>escape characters,</span><a href = "#reflink4"><sup> [4]</sup></a>
               the way we protect against that according to Silva, Barbosa and Bernardino (2020)<a id = "reflink8" class = "rlink" href="#r8"><sup> [8]</sup></a>
               is to use standardized frameworks, which they state can include:</p><br>
            <q>
               <ul style="margin-left: 1.2em;">
                <li>Reject binary, escape and comment characters;</li>
                <li>Verification of user privileges when connecting to database;</li>
                <li>Strong password for system administrator;</li>
                <li>Use secure hash algorithms;</li>
                <li>Use least privilege rule.</li>
            </ul>
            </q><br>
            <p>In turn using these rules would protect you against our basic SQli attack before, and it also gives developers standard insight on how to mitigate or prevent serious losses by
               stopping the attack from going further. 
            </p><br>
